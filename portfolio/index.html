      <pre class="h4">
- "I'd rather find out what she didn't keep and why she didn't keep them." noticed there were fit notes – tried to speed read through notes
- "people are not very decisive about their … er they have sorta wishy washy opinions about themselves"
- tries to send them an assortment of items
- usually remembers notes on items, (but seems to be using them to refresh her memory)
- people ask for ridiculous things, like brides maid dress, etc.
- jxn: how often do you get requests like that? m: every day, very frequently
- "and we give ourselves an internal ranking too. i don't know what eric does with that. i guess to see how confident we are."
- jxn: how often do you give yourself a 3? m: rarely, i give myself a lot of 1s.
- jxn: do you feel like you get more confident over time? m: no, it has more to do with inventory. and the algorithm is so much better, like it's crazy. in october it would take her 10 minutes per shipment. because nothing was organized. it wasn't very organized. it was random.
- jxn: do you still find yourself looking for specify items? m: not as much anymore cause our inventory is so much better. and i feel confident in what the buyers are doing. we also have our client more pigeonholed. i think we have a better idea of what will sell.
- ignores older shipments because our inventory was worse.
- the pinterest thing has been super valuable. because you have this easy, succinct, visual platform - "i mean she doesn't have a pinterest page, this sucks. you can look at someone's pinterest page for two seconds and be like, oh I know exactly who you are."
- "I mean this is really not helpful. You know, I don't know what she looks like."
- googles people if she doesn't have a lot of information internally. found someone with the same name, not the client.
- mentions vagueness of occupation field
- "I'd like them to tell me their top ten favorite books"
- has some personal favorites that she likes to send out
- usual order: tops, outer layers, dresses if they like them, 
- she's really tall, that's sort of an issue, a lot of our stuff is short.
- jxn: we don't ask about length prefs, right? m: no
- "I'm looking at her, she's 28, 5'9" 127 lbs. I mean, she kinda has a hot body. right? and if she's a D, she's looking pretty good these days. Hey man, well you know what, you can wear something hot. Cause you're young enough and you live in new york. let's branch out here."
- jxn: question about stylists bg – m: 
- what do you find fun about all this? m: I'm kind of a people person and i love imagining who this person is and making her feel good. i think it's interesting to look at what she does and doesn't like, and wonder why, get to know her more. i sometimes style the VIP bloggers, it's fun to get to know them, read their blog, … trying to make it as personal as possible. 
- it's sorta like a restaurant or bar. people go to you, and they tell you personal things about themselves, and they ask you to help them with something. it's a way to make them feel better. people continue to come back to you because they trust you. i would rather create these sorta regulars and have sorta real relationships with. (skeptical about scalability)
- would like to see more algorithm automation, make the process more about conversation with clients
- mentions difficulty of styling the first fix because we don't really know the client yet.
- mentions pinterest and blogs again.
- mentions a stylists twitter account
