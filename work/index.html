      <p class="h3 serif">
        One of the first things I noticed when I started working at Kickstarter
        was how the other designers were struggling with and spending a lot of time on front-end development.
        These were smart, talented people, but
        writing HTML and CSS shouldn’t be that hard and shouldn’t take that long.
        I had to dig a little further to figure out what was going on.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        I quickly noticed that the page load took about 5 seconds and that the minified
        CSS file was 1.1MB.
        One thing I've learned over the years is that performance matters <em>a lot</em> –
        for both business goals and user experience –
        and even with caching, CSS of that size will certainly cause page rendering problems.
        For some reason, no one seemed to be paying attention to front-end rendering performance.
        Who knows how much money creators are missing out on or how many cool projects go unnoticed.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mb1">Priorities</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        There was also an obvious bottleneck in design process.
        <del>
          With no up-front user research,
          projects were treated as one-off, top-down items on a checklist,
          and the designers had little to no room for creative exploration.
          This approach also seems to lead to a lack of collaborative design and communication
          and flies in the face of everything I’ve learned about agile software development over the years.
        </del>
        This seemed like a much larger organizational issue,
        so I decided to punt on it for the time being.
      </p>

      <!--
        or the broken mobile web experience.
        For such a simple consumer-facing site, there's no reason we couldn't build a faster, responsive site.
        <h2 class="h3 mb2">Our 1.1MB minified CSS and our workflow needed some serious refactoring.</h2>
      -->
      <h2 class="mb1">Refactoring Workflows and 1.1MB of CSS</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        I went about tackling some of the front-end architecture and workflow problems,
        while aiming to better document our style guide and pattern library.
        This also meant cleaning up and consolidating all the inconsistent styles
        across the nearly five-year-old app.
      </p>

      <p class="h5 mid-gray">Mixins like this one don't save time for anyone.</p>
      <p class="serif">
        The legacy CSS architecture used a plethora of Sass mixins and was organized by Rails views.
        The old architecture “scoped” each view by using the body’s id at the beginning of the cascade.
        CSS cannot be scoped – it’s global by nature - and I knew the architecture they were using was
        generally considered bad practice.
        The outcome of this approach was that virtually no styles were reusable,
        and the designers were spending a lot of time rewriting styles.
        Even the typographic scale and grid system used mixins that created a lot of duplicative code.

      <h2 class="mb1">Getting Everyone On Board</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        After discussing with the other designers and developers,
        we decided to begin architecting an OOCSS-based library to slowly ween us off the old system.
        The other front-end designers were very enthusiastic, quickly picked up the new CSS approach,
        and immediately began contributing.
        Each new feature rolled out since then has relied heavily on the new library styles and,
        although there hasn’t been a dedicated effort to refactor,
        we’ve managed to reduce the overall size of our CSS by about <strong>25%</strong> – from about 1.1MB to 855KB.

    <p class="h3 serif">
      Stitch Fix is a women’s fashion subscription service
      built around a custom recommendation algorithm
      and trained in-house stylists. It’s what people within the company call a “mullet app”
      – that is, neat and simple in the front with a complex mess in the back.
    </p>
    <pre>Screen of site/nav/etc</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      I joined just after the launch of their new consumer-facing site as lead designer.
      We spent a month or so cleaning up small parts of the site, including the landing page,
      sign up flow, site navigation, visual branding, and the company blog.
      I worked with the Marketing Director to help develop an A/B testing strategy 
      for the site that she could run while we shifted our focus to internal tools.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb1">A Faster Experience</h2>
    <p class="serif">
      Based on company priorities and the bottlenecks in the user journey
      – new customers generally had to wait 4 – 6 weeks after signing up to actually use the service –
      we decided to turn our focus towards replacing the internal tool that the stylists used to research customers
      and choose the clothing and accessories we sent them.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      The tool that the stylists were using was build on Django
      and was essentially a series of tables displaying the database. 
      We knew about a lot of low-hanging fruit,
      but I decided to do some lean UX research before landing on any one direction.
    </p>
    <pre>gif of silverback video</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      The first week, I ran testing sessions with four stylists.
      The sessions began with an open-ended contextual inquiry
      and lead into shadowing each participant as they
      went through their normal workflow.
      After transcribing highlights and taking notes,
      I shared the results with the rest of the development team and we discussed the findings.
    </p>
    <pre>Photo from sketch session</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      The second week, I facilitated a post-it note sketching session with the entire team of stylists.
      Coming from non-product-development jobs before, they really enjoyed the session,
      and a lot of great ideas came out of it.
      After documenting the session, the development team met again to discuss.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      The next two weeks, we focused on sketching ideas and building rapid prototypes to test with.
      We came up with a lot of different ideas, including a binary image-based wizard flow,
      a keyboard command based app, a social-network like conversation view,
      and one that followed patterns in traditional e-commerce apps.
      In an effort to release an MVP soon, we decided to focus on the e-commerce-influenced direction.
    </p>
    <pre>gif of silverback video</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      I continued our research by user testing the new prototype with four different stylists.
      We continued to iterate on the prototype throughout the testing in attempt to make
      the transition to the new app as easy as possible for the stylists.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      I'd made plenty of prototypes in the past, using HTML & CSS and tools like Ratchet, Keynote, Blueprint,
      but I knew next to nothing about Javascript and felt like my CSS was not production-ready.
      We originally planned to have the front-end developer build the actual app and to keep
      the prototypes on separate branches.
      At the time, the front-end developer was busy with tools to speed up the warehouse operations.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      After several code reviews and some coaching from the front-end developer,
      we decided that we should clean up the prototype a bit and ship it,
      with the intent of consolidating components and better organizing the code as we went along.
      During that time, he taught me a lot about CSS and front-end architecture,
      and I took it upon myself to learn more about Javascript and front-end MVCs.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      Although the team of stylists was nowhere near large enough to get significant data from,
      we wanted to be sure that the new app wouldn’t negatively affect their workflows.
      We decided to split the team into two groups:
      one continuing to use the old app and another using the new one.
      After about a week of use, the stylists more than doubled their output using the new app.
      We knew we had a clear winner, and switched the entire team over.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      During this time, we continued to shadow and monitor the stylists to make sure we 
      addressed any of their concerns.
      The development team and I also discussed the use of a front-end MVC framework
      instead of forcing jQuery to work in ways it wasn’t intended to.
      In my own time, I began teaching myself Angular JS and built
      <a href="http://soundrad.com">soundrad.com</a>
      to vet the framework.
