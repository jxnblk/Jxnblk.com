      <p class="h3 serif">
        One of the first things I noticed when I started working at Kickstarter
        was how the other designers were struggling with and spending a lot of time on front-end development.
        These were smart, talented people,
        and writing HTML and CSS shouldn’t be that hard and shouldn’t take that long.
        I had to dig a little further to figure out what was going on.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        I quickly noticed that the page load took about 5 seconds and that the minified
        CSS file was 1.1MB.
        One thing I’ve learned over the years is that performance matters <em>a lot</em> –
        for both business goals and user experience –
        and even with caching, CSS of that size will certainly cause page rendering problems.
        For some reason, no one seemed to be paying attention to front-end rendering performance.
        Who knows how much money creators are missing out on or how many cool projects go unnoticed.
      </p>

      <!--
      <h2 class="mb1">Priorities</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        There was also an obvious bottleneck in design process.
        The designers were generally brought on board late in the process,
        and there was little to no collaboration or critiquing between the designers.
        This seemed like a much larger organizational issue,
        so I decided to punt on it for the time being.

      <h2 class="mb1">Refactoring Workflows and 1.1MB of CSS</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        I went about tackling some of the front-end architecture and workflow problems,
        while aiming to better document our style guide and pattern library.
        This also meant cleaning up and consolidating all the inconsistent styles
        across the nearly five-year-old app.

      <p class="h5 mid-gray">Mixins like this one don’t help anyone.</p>
      <p class="serif">
        The legacy CSS architecture used a plethora of Sass mixins and was organized by Rails views.
        The old architecture “scoped” each view by using the body’s id at the beginning of the cascade.
        CSS cannot be scoped – it’s global by nature - and I knew the architecture they were using was
        generally considered bad practice.
        The outcome of this approach was that virtually no styles were reusable,
        and the designers were spending a lot of time writing CSS.
        Even the typographic scale and grid system used mixins that created a lot of duplicative code.

        After discussing with the other designers and developers,
        we decided to begin architecting an OOCSS-based library to slowly ween us off the old system.
        The other front-end designers were very enthusiastic, quickly picked up the new CSS approach,
        and immediately began contributing.
        Each new feature rolled out since then has relied heavily on the new library styles and,
        although there hasn’t been a dedicated effort to refactor,
        we’ve managed to reduce the overall size of our CSS by about <strong>25%</strong> – from about 1.1MB to 855KB.

        I joined just after the launch of their new consumer-facing site as lead designer.
        We spent a month or so cleaning up small parts of the site, including the landing page,
        sign up flow, site navigation, visual branding, and the company blog.
        I worked with the Marketing Director to help develop an A/B testing strategy 
        for the site that she could run while we shifted our focus to internal tools.

      <h2 class="mb1">A Faster Experience</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        Based on company priorities and the bottlenecks in the user journey
        – new customers generally had to wait 4 – 6 weeks after signing up to actually use the service –
        we decided to turn our focus towards replacing the internal tool that the stylists used to research customers
        and choose the clothing and accessories we sent them.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The tool that the stylists were using was built with Django
        and was essentially a series of tables displaying the database. 
        We knew about a lot of low-hanging fruit,
        but I decided to do some lean UX research before landing on any one direction.

            The first week, I ran testing sessions with four stylists.
            The sessions began with an open-ended contextual inquiry
            and lead into shadowing each participant as they
            went through their normal workflow.
            After transcribing highlights and taking notes,
            I shared the results with the rest of the development team and we discussed the findings.

        The next two weeks, we focused on sketching ideas and building rapid prototypes to test with.
        We came up with a lot of different ideas, including a binary image-based wizard flow,
        a keyboard command based app, a social-network like conversation view,
        and one that followed patterns in traditional e-commerce apps.
        In an effort to release an MVP soon, we decided to focus on the e-commerce-influenced direction.

      <p class="serif">
        I’d made plenty of prototypes in the past, using HTML & CSS and tools like Ratchet, Keynote, and Blueprint,
        but I knew next to nothing about Javascript and didn’t think my CSS was not production-ready.
        We originally planned to have the front-end developer build the actual app and to keep
        the prototypes on separate branches.
        At the time, the developer was busy working on tools for warehouse operations.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        After several code reviews and some coaching from the front-end developer,
        we decided that we should clean up the prototype a bit and ship it,
        with the intent of consolidating components and better organizing the code as we went along.
        During that time, he taught me a lot about CSS and front-end architecture,
        and I took it upon myself to learn more about Javascript and front-end MVCs.

        Although the team of stylists was nowhere near large enough to get significant data from,
        we wanted to be sure that the new app wouldn’t negatively affect their workflows.
        We decided to split the team into two groups:
        one continuing to use the old app and another using the new one.
        After about a week of use, the stylists more than doubled their output using the new app.
        We knew we had a clear winner, and switched the entire team over.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        During this time, we continued to shadow and monitor the stylists to make sure we 
        addressed any of their concerns.
        The development team and I also discussed the use of a front-end MVC framework
        instead of forcing jQuery to work in ways it wasn’t intended to.
        In my own time, I began teaching myself Angular JS and built
        <a href="http://soundrad.com">soundrad.com</a>

        The first project I worked on at LivingSocial was the logo and branding.
        At the time they were using a very startup-like logo designed in under an hour by local agency Nclud,
        and they wanted to elevate the brand to more accurately reflect the size of company they were becoming.
        Informed by branding work started by an outside agency,
        I worked on a team with two other designers, and we each went on our own to begin sketching ideas.
        About twice a week we would meet in person to share ideas and critique each others work.

      <p class="serif">
        After about two weeks of sketching and critiquing,
        we paired down our options to two directions each
        to share with stakeholders across the company.
        Ultimately type treatment from one of my options and a mark conceived by my coworker were chosen.
        She continued working on refining the concept and building out the branding system,

            I was flattered, but I had to scramble to clean up the icons

        the business model just wasn’t working.
        The company decided to pivot and turn this product into a direct competitor with Seamless.
        I worked on IA for an app that would host several hundred different restaurants
        with drastically different menus.
        I spoke with several internal sales people and a few local restaurants to research what their needs were.

        The design team and the product grew quite a bit over the next few months.
        User research had shown that customers’ brand perception and understanding
        of our product offerings was failing our business goals.
        The newly hired UX Director got the entire design team (around 16 of us) together to work
        on the consumer-facing product’s IA.
        We split into five teams of about three or four people each to brainstorm and sketch out ideas,
        meeting regularly with the entire team to critique and discuss.

        One of my coworkers on the team had conducted an online open card sort,
        and had been working with the Marketing team’s research to help inform our direction.
        Using groupings and labels based on this research,
        we created a content model, proposed a navigation system for both mobile and desktop,
        and created a clickable prototype using Bootstrap to demonstrate a responsive
        website using this new system.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        After stealing a few ideas from the others, the entire team decided that the direction
        we were working on was the strongest. We presented it to the executive team
        and the rest of the product development team and got immediate buy in.

        A few of us on the UX team went to IA Summit in New Orleans.
        I had a blast and was very inspired by the speakers and workshops I attended.
        But the timing of the flight caused me to miss an outside product management consultant’s
        work and presentation on our company’s process and organization.
        When I flew back to DC, the entire product development team was now organized by team pods
        that aligned with the new product IA.

        Part of the new IA and company organization required every designer to work on the mobile
        component of their product, rather than siloing it off to a separate team.
        With the support of the UX Director, I was a huge proponent for
        mobile-first responsive design, and I spent most of my time working closely with the other designers
        on designing and building with this approach.
        I became the go-to guy for anything mobile related, and I learned a lot about teaching others design.

        Shortly after, in the year 2048, I found myself caught up in a heated laser cannon battle with highly evolved bears.
        I had to get back to the year 2012, but time my re-entry wrong and ran straight into a cab door.
        After talking to HR and my manager, I decided to stay on part-time and participated in
        and facilitated every design studio session the UX team held.
        I learned a lot then, including how it’s easier to type one handed than use Adobe apps,
        that my left-handed sketches looked more like cave paintings than interfaces,
        and that cross-team strong communication can lead to a lot of great things.

        Hired as their first dedicated visual designer, I worked closely with the UX designer and web team
        on their first web application and their flagship direct mail product.
        I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and used Subversion version control for the first time.
        I helped the UX designer build and iterate on prototypes for testing.

        As the company grew and they began working on the next version of the web app,
        and after unknowingly breaking the build several times,
        I stopped working in code and began shadowing the UX designer more closely.
        I built out the visual style guide for the app, along with an icon system,
        and worked on many energy data visualizations that are still in use today.
