      <p class="h3 serif">
        One of the first things I noticed when I started working at
        <a href="//kickstarter.com" target="_blank" class="dark-gray">
          Kickstarter
        </a>
        was how the other designers were struggling with and spending a lot of time on front-end development.
        These were smart, talented people,
        and writing HTML and CSS shouldn’t be that hard or take that long.
        I had to dig a little further to figure out what was going on.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        I also noticed that the page load took about 5 seconds and that the minified
        CSS file was 1.1MB.
        One thing I’ve learned over the years is that performance matters <em>a lot</em> –
        for both business goals and user experience –
        and even with caching, CSS of that size will certainly cause page rendering problems.
        For some reason, no one seemed to be paying attention to front-end rendering performance.
        Who knows how much money creators are missing out on or how many cool projects go unnoticed.
      </p>

      <h2 class="">Refactoring Workflows and 1.1MB of CSS</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        I went about tackling some of the front-end architecture and workflow problems,
        while aiming to better document our style guide and pattern library.
        This also meant cleaning up and consolidating all the inconsistent styles
        across the nearly five-year-old app.

      <p class="h5 mid-gray">Mixins like this one don’t help anyone.</p>
      <p class="serif">
        The legacy CSS architecture used a plethora of Sass mixins and was organized by Rails views.
        The old architecture “scoped” each view by using the body’s id at the beginning of the cascade.
        CSS cannot be scoped – it’s global by nature - and I knew the architecture they were using was
        generally considered bad practice.
        The outcome of this approach was that virtually no styles were reusable,
        and the designers were spending a lot of time writing CSS.
        Even the typographic scale and grid system used mixins that created a lot of duplicative code.

      <h2 class="">Getting Everyone On Board</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        After discussing with the other designers and developers,
        we decided to begin architecting an OOCSS-based library to slowly ween us off the old system.
        The other front-end designers were very enthusiastic, quickly picked up the new CSS approach,
        and immediately began contributing.
        Each new feature rolled out since then has relied heavily on the new library styles and,
        although there hasn’t been a dedicated effort to refactor,
        we’ve managed to reduce the overall size of our CSS by about <strong>30%</strong> – from about 1.1MB to 777KB.

        I joined just after the launch of their new consumer-facing site as lead designer.
        We spent a month or so cleaning up small parts of the site, including the landing page,
        sign up flow, site navigation, visual branding, and the company blog.
        I worked with the Marketing Director to help develop an A/B testing strategy 
        for the site that she could run while we shifted our focus to internal tools.
      </p>
      <h2 class="">A Faster Experience</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        Based on company priorities and the bottlenecks in the user journey
        – new customers generally had to wait 4–6 weeks after signing up to actually use the service –
        we decided to turn our focus towards replacing the internal tool that the stylists used to research customers
        and choose the clothing and accessories we sent them.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The current tool was essentially a series of tables displaying the database. 
        We knew about a lot of low-hanging fruit,
        but I decided to do some user research before landing on any one direction.

          <p class="serif">
            The first week, I ran testing sessions with four stylists.
            The sessions began with an open-ended contextual inquiry
            and lead into shadowing each participant as they
            went through their normal workflow.
            After transcribing highlights and taking notes,
            I shared the results with the rest of the development team and we discussed the findings.

            Coming from non-product-development jobs before, they really enjoyed the session,
            and a lot of great ideas came out of it.
            After documenting the session, the development team met again to discuss.

        The next two weeks, we focused on sketching ideas and building rapid prototypes to test with.
        We came up with a lot of different ideas, including a binary image-based wizard flow,
        a keyboard command based app, a social-network like conversation view,
        and one that followed patterns from traditional e-commerce apps.
        In an effort to release an MVP soon, we decided to focus on the e-commerce-influenced direction.

            I continued our research by testing the new prototype with four different stylists.
            We iterated on the prototype throughout the testing in an attempt to make
            the transition to the new app as easy as possible for the stylists.

      <h2 class="">Prototype to Rapid Prototype</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        I’d made plenty of prototypes in the past, using HTML & CSS and tools like Ratchet, Keynote, and Blueprint,
        but I knew next to nothing about Javascript and didn’t think my CSS was good enough to be production-ready.
        We originally planned to have the front-end developer build the actual app and to keep
        the prototypes on separate branches.
        At the time, the developer was busy working on other tools for our warehouse operations.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        After several code reviews and some coaching,
        we decided that we should just clean up the prototype that I'd built and ship it,
        with the intent of consolidating components and better organizing the code as we went along.
        During that time, the front-end developer taught me a lot about CSS and front-end architecture,
        and I took it upon myself to learn more about Javascript and front-end MVCs.

    <div class="measure">
      <p class="serif">
        Although the team of stylists wasn't large enough to get signficant data from,
        we wanted to be sure that the new app wouldn’t negatively affect their workflows.
        We decided to split the team into two groups:
        one continuing to use the old app and another using the new one.
        After about a week of use, the stylists more than doubled their output using the new app.
        We knew we had a clear winner, and switched the entire team over.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        During this time, we continued to shadow and monitor the stylists to make sure we 
        addressed any of their concerns.
        The development team and I also discussed the use of a front-end MVC framework
        instead of forcing jQuery to work in ways it wasn’t intended to.
        In my own time, I began teaching myself Angular JS and built
        <a href="http://soundrad.com" target="_blank">soundrad.com</a>
        to vet the framework.

        The design team and the product grew quite a bit over the next few months.
        User research had shown that customers’ brand perception and understanding
        of our product offerings was failing our business goals.
        The newly hired UX Director got the entire design team together to work
        on the consumer-facing product’s IA.
        We split into five teams of three to four people each to brainstorm and sketch out ideas,
        meeting regularly with the entire team to critique and discuss.

        One of my coworkers on the team had conducted an online open card sort
        and had been working with the user research and Marketing teams to help inform our direction.
        Using groupings and labels based on this research,
        we created a content model, proposed a navigation system for both mobile and desktop,
        and created a clickable prototype using <i>Bootstrap</i> to demonstrate a responsive
        website using this new system.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        After we stole a few ideas from the others, the design team decided that the direction
        my group had was the strongest. We presented it to the executives 
        and the rest of the product development team and got immediate buy in.

      <h2>Reorganizing</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        Soon after, a few of us on the UX team went to <i>IA Summit</i> in New Orleans.
        I had a blast and was very inspired by the speakers I saw.
        But the timing of my flight caused me to miss an outside product management consultant’s
        work and presentation on our company’s process and organization.
        When I flew back to DC, the entire product development team was now organized by pods
        that aligned with the new product IA.

      <h2>Championing a Mobile-First Approach</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        Part of the new IA and company organization required every designer to work on the mobile
        component of their product, rather than delegating it to a separate team.
        With the support of the UX Director, I was a huge proponent of mobile-first responsive design,
        and I spent most of my time working closely with the other designers on using this approach.
        I became the go-to guy for anything mobile related, and I learned a lot about teaching others.

      <h2>My Fifth Metacarpal</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        Shortly after, I was doored by a cab while riding my bike and broke the fifth metacarpal in my dominant hand.
        After talking to HR and my manager, I decided to
        continue working in a different capacity – in more of a UX director role –
        and participated in or facilitated every design studio session the UX team held.
        I learned a lot then, including how it’s easier to type one handed than use Adobe apps,
        that my left-handed sketches looked more like cave paintings than interfaces,
        that cross-team strong communication can lead to a lot of great things,
        and that some of the most important parts of design process don’t require a computer at all.

        That summer, the CTO had asked me and two other mobile developers to move to San Francisco
        to work on skunkworks mobile apps and help build a product development team out there.

        Hired as their first dedicated visual designer, I worked closely with the UX designer and web team
        on their first web application and their flagship direct mail product.
        I learned a lot about data visualization, HTML, CSS, used Subversion version control for the first time,
        and helped the UX designer build and iterate on prototypes for user testing.

        As the company grew and they began working on the next version of the web app,
        and after unknowingly breaking the build several times,
        I stopped working in code and began shadowing the UX designer more closely.
        I built out the visual style guide for the web app and print products,
        along with an icon set and grid system,
        and worked on many energy data visualizations that are still in use today.

        After realizing my knack for icon design, I created a set of my own and began selling them.
        To date, I’ve sold over 2,000 copies of this icon set.
        I've since open-sourced it and have created two other sets.
