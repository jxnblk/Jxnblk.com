      <p class="h3 serif">
        One of the first things I noticed when I started working at Kickstarter
        was how the other designers were struggling with and spending a lot of time on front-end development.
        These were smart, talented people, but
        writing HTML and CSS shouldn’t be that hard and shouldn’t take that long.
        I had to dig a little further to figure out what was going on.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        I quickly noticed that the page load took about 5 seconds and that the minified
        CSS file was 1.1MB.
        One thing I've learned over the years is that performance matters <em>a lot</em> –
        for both business goals and user experience –
        and even with caching, CSS of that size will certainly cause page rendering problems.
        For some reason, no one seemed to be paying attention to front-end rendering performance.
        Who knows how much money creators are missing out on or how many cool projects go unnoticed.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mb1">Priorities</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        There was also an obvious bottleneck in design process.
        <del>
          With no up-front user research,
          projects were treated as one-off, top-down items on a checklist,
          and the designers had little to no room for creative exploration.
          This approach also seems to lead to a lack of collaborative design and communication
          and flies in the face of everything I’ve learned about agile software development over the years.
        </del>
        This seemed like a much larger organizational issue,
        so I decided to punt on it for the time being.
      </p>

      <!--
        or the broken mobile web experience.
        For such a simple consumer-facing site, there's no reason we couldn't build a faster, responsive site.
        <h2 class="h3 mb2">Our 1.1MB minified CSS and our workflow needed some serious refactoring.</h2>
      -->
      <h2 class="mb1">Refactoring Workflows and 1.1MB of CSS</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        I went about tackling some of the front-end architecture and workflow problems,
        while aiming to better document our style guide and pattern library.
        This also meant cleaning up and consolidating all the inconsistent styles
        across the nearly five-year-old app.

      <p class="h5 mid-gray">Mixins like this one don't save time for anyone.</p>
      <p class="serif">
        The legacy CSS architecture used a plethora of Sass mixins and was organized by Rails views.
        The old architecture “scoped” each view by using the body’s id at the beginning of the cascade.
        CSS cannot be scoped – it’s global by nature - and I knew the architecture they were using was
        generally considered bad practice.
        The outcome of this approach was that virtually no styles were reusable,
        and the designers were spending a lot of time rewriting styles.
        Even the typographic scale and grid system used mixins that created a lot of duplicative code.

      <h2 class="mb1">Getting Everyone On Board</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        After discussing with the other designers and developers,
        we decided to begin architecting an OOCSS-based library to slowly ween us off the old system.
        The other front-end designers were very enthusiastic, quickly picked up the new CSS approach,
        and immediately began contributing.
        Each new feature rolled out since then has relied heavily on the new library styles and,
        although there hasn’t been a dedicated effort to refactor,
        we’ve managed to reduce the overall size of our CSS by about <strong>25%</strong> – from about 1.1MB to 855KB.

    </header>

    <p class="h3 serif">
      Stitch Fix is a women’s fashion subscription service
      built around a custom recommendation algorithm
      and trained in-house stylists. It’s what people within the company call a “mullet app”
      – that is, neat and simple in the front with a complex mess in the back.
    </p>
    <pre>Screen of site/nav/etc</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      I joined just after the launch of their new consumer-facing site as lead designer.
      We spent a month or so cleaning up small parts of the site, including the landing page,
      sign up flow, site navigation, visual branding, and the company blog.
      I worked with the Marketing Director to help develop an A/B testing strategy 
      for the site that she could run while we shifted our focus to internal tools.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb1">A Faster Experience</h2>
    <p class="serif">
      Based on company priorities and the bottlenecks in the user journey
      – new customers generally had to wait 4 – 6 weeks after signing up to actually use the service –
      we decided to turn our focus towards replacing the internal tool that the stylists used to research customers
      and choose the clothing and accessories we sent them.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      The tool that the stylists were using was build on Django
      and was essentially a series of tables displaying the database. 
      We knew about a lot of low-hanging fruit,
      but I decided to do some lean UX research before landing on any one direction.
    </p>
    <pre>gif of silverback video</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      The first week, I ran testing sessions with four stylists.
      The sessions began with an open-ended contextual inquiry
      and lead into shadowing each participant as they
      went through their normal workflow.
      After transcribing highlights and taking notes,
      I shared the results with the rest of the development team and we discussed the findings.
    </p>
    <pre>Photo from sketch session</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      The second week, I facilitated a post-it note sketching session with the entire team of stylists.
      Coming from non-product-development jobs before, they really enjoyed the session,
      and a lot of great ideas came out of it.
      After documenting the session, the development team met again to discuss.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      The next two weeks, we focused on sketching ideas and building rapid prototypes to test with.
      We came up with a lot of different ideas, including a binary image-based wizard flow,
      a keyboard command based app, a social-network like conversation view,
      and one that followed patterns in traditional e-commerce apps.
      In an effort to release an MVP soon, we decided to focus on the e-commerce-influenced direction.
    </p>
    <pre>gif of silverback video</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      I continued our research by user testing the new prototype with four different stylists.
      We continued to iterate on the prototype throughout the testing in attempt to make
      the transition to the new app as easy as possible for the stylists.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      I'd made plenty of prototypes in the past, using HTML & CSS and tools like Ratchet, Keynote, Blueprint,
      but I knew next to nothing about Javascript and felt like my CSS was not production-ready.
      We originally planned to have the front-end developer build the actual app and to keep
      the prototypes on separate branches.
      At the time, the front-end developer was busy with tools to speed up the warehouse operations.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      After several code reviews and some coaching from the front-end developer,
      we decided that we should clean up the prototype a bit and ship it,
      with the intent of consolidating components and better organizing the code as we went along.
      During that time, he taught me a lot about CSS and front-end architecture,
      and I took it upon myself to learn more about Javascript and front-end MVCs.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      Although the team of stylists was nowhere near large enough to get significant data from,
      we wanted to be sure that the new app wouldn’t negatively affect their workflows.
      We decided to split the team into two groups:
      one continuing to use the old app and another using the new one.
      After about a week of use, the stylists more than doubled their output using the new app.
      We knew we had a clear winner, and switched the entire team over.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      During this time, we continued to shadow and monitor the stylists to make sure we 
      addressed any of their concerns.
      The development team and I also discussed the use of a front-end MVC framework
      instead of forcing jQuery to work in ways it wasn’t intended to.
      In my own time, I began teaching myself Angular JS and built
      <a href="http://soundrad.com">soundrad.com</a>
      to vet the framework.

    </header>
    <p class="serif">
      The first project I worked on at LivingSocial was the logo and branding.
      At the time they were using a very startup-like logo designed in under an hour by local agency Nclud,
      and they wanted to elevate the brand to more accurately reflect the size of company they were becoming.
      Informed by branding work started by an outside agency,
      I worked on a team with two other designers, and we each went on our own to begin sketching ideas.
      About twice a week we would meet in person to share ideas and critique each others work.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      After about two weeks of sketching and critiquing,
      we paired down our options to two directions each
      to share with stakeholders across the company.
      Ultimately type treatment from one of my options and a mark conceived by my coworker were chosen.
      She continued working on refining the concept and building out the branding system,
      while I switched to on a revamp of the iPhone app.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      I learned that you should be careful what you leave on the outside of your Illustrator artboards.
      As the final branding was revealed to the teams,
      I'd noticed that some of my rough icon sketches were all over the place.
      I was flattered, but I had to scramble to clean up the icons
      I'd started before they began using them for billboards in Times Square.
    </p>
    <pre>Times Square photo</pre>

    <p class="serif">
      The platform was growing quickly and there was a desire test out several new products in different markets.
      The iPhone app at the time, built in a hurry, was not well suited to scale to meet business goals,
      so a product manager, the iOS developer, and I began brainstorming and sketching ideas for the next version.
      There was also the need to update the visual design for the new branding.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      I mocked up several directions for the app, using the new, still evolving visual identity,
      and regularly checked in with rest of the design team for group critiques,
      iterating on the different options as we went along.
    </p>
    <pre>v2 iPhone App</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      With the desire to release the new app in time for the branding unveiling in our Super Bowl Ad,
      we iterated on a couple directions for an MVP and did guerilla usability testing in the Chinatown
      neighborhood of DC.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      Over the next weeks, we continued to iterate on the app,
      with a new release going out about once every two weeks.
      One of the big new products the company wanted to launch was a mobile-only
      instantly-redeemable deals platform.
      This product would only launch in specific markets and we explored several different options
      for how to handle the location-based app navigation.
    </p>
    <pre>Instant Deals</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      Launching with a huge PR stunt in DC,
      with the company offering a $1 lunch for anyone using the new <em>Instant Deals</em> product,
      the backend infrastructure got hit hard,
      and the development team worked all day to keep things running.
      Meanwhile, the executive team realized that they needed a desktop counterpart
      for their mobile-only product.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      Taking direction from the design of the mobile app,
      I worked closely with a front-end developer to design and build a desktop version.
      The CTO had a saying, JSIO: just shit it out, and we did just that.
      That was a long day.
    </p>
    <pre>Redemption App Prototype & Merchant Center Wireframes</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      Around the same time, the company had been working with a local agency to build
      merchant tools for these new products. The company acquired this agency,
      and I began working with them on information architecture and an MVP for the merchant tools.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      After several attempts at marketing this product in a dozen or so markets,
      the business model just wasn't working.
      The company decided to pivot and turn this product into a direct competitor with Seamless.
      I worked on IA for an app that would host several hundred different restaurants
      with drastically different menus.
      I spoke with several internal sales people and a few local restaurants to research what their needs were.
    </p>
    <pre>Online Ordering diagrams, sketches, mockups</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      The design team and the product grew quite a bit over the next few months.
      User research had shown that customers' brand perception and understanding
      of our product offerings was failing our business goals.
      The newly hired UX Director got the entire design team (around 16 of us) together to work
      on the consumer-facing product's IA.
      We split into five teams of about three or four people each to brainstorm and sketch out ideas,
      meeting regularly with the entire team to critique and discuss.
    </p>
    <pre>Content Objects Diagram</pre>
    <pre>Mobile/Desktop Navigation Mapping</pre>
    <pre>Responsive Desktop Prototype</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      One of my coworkers on the team had conducted an online open card sort,
      and had been working with the Marketing team's research to help inform our direction.
      Using groupings and labels based on this research,
      we created a content model, proposed a navigation system for both mobile and desktop,
      and created a clickable prototype using Bootstrap to demonstrate a responsive
      website using this new system.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      After stealing a few ideas from the others, the entire team decided that the direction
      we were working on was the strongest. We presented it to the executive team
      and the rest of the product development team and got immediate buy in.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      A few of us on the UX team went to IA Summit in New Orleans.
      I had a blast and was very inspired by the speakers and workshops I attended.
      But the timing of the flight caused me to miss an outside product management consultant's
      work and presentation on our company's process and organization.
      When I flew back to DC, the entire product development team was now organized by team pods
      that aligned with the new product IA.
    </p>
    <pre>iPhone app assets</pre>
    <pre>Mobile Style Guide</pre>
    <p class="serif">
      Part of the new IA and company organization required every designer to work on the mobile
      component of their product, rather than siloing it off to a separate team.
      With the support of the UX Director, I was a huge proponent for
      mobile-first responsive design, and I spent most of my time working closely with the other designers
      on designing and building with this approach.
      I became the go-to guy for anything mobile related, and I learned a lot about teaching others design.
