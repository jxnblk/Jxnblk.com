      <p class="h3 serif">
        One of the first things I noticed when I started working at Kickstarter
        was how the other designers were struggling with and spending a lot of time on front-end development.
        These were smart, talented people,
        and writing HTML and CSS shouldn’t be that hard and shouldn’t take that long.
        I had to dig a little further to figure out what was going on.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        I quickly noticed that the page load took about 5 seconds and that the minified
        CSS file was 1.1MB.
        One thing I’ve learned over the years is that performance matters <em>a lot</em> –
        for both business goals and user experience –
        and even with caching, CSS of that size will certainly cause page rendering problems.
        For some reason, no one seemed to be paying attention to front-end rendering performance.
        Who knows how much money creators are missing out on or how many cool projects go unnoticed.
      </p>

      <!--
      <h2 class="">Priorities</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        There was also an obvious bottleneck in design process.
        The designers were generally brought on board late in the process,
        and there was little to no collaboration or critiquing between the designers.
        This seemed like a much larger organizational issue,
        so I decided to punt on it for the time being.

        or the broken mobile web experience.

      -->
      <h2 class="">Refactoring Workflows and 1.1MB of CSS</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        I went about tackling some of the front-end architecture and workflow problems,
        while aiming to better document our style guide and pattern library.
        This also meant cleaning up and consolidating all the inconsistent styles
        across the nearly five-year-old app.

      <p class="h5 mid-gray">Mixins like this one don’t help anyone.</p>
      <p class="serif">
        The legacy CSS architecture used a plethora of Sass mixins and was organized by Rails views.
        The old architecture “scoped” each view by using the body’s id at the beginning of the cascade.
        CSS cannot be scoped – it’s global by nature - and I knew the architecture they were using was
        generally considered bad practice.
        The outcome of this approach was that virtually no styles were reusable,
        and the designers were spending a lot of time writing CSS.
        Even the typographic scale and grid system used mixins that created a lot of duplicative code.

        After discussing with the other designers and developers,
        we decided to begin architecting an OOCSS-based library to slowly ween us off the old system.
        The other front-end designers were very enthusiastic, quickly picked up the new CSS approach,
        and immediately began contributing.
        Each new feature rolled out since then has relied heavily on the new library styles and,
        although there hasn’t been a dedicated effort to refactor,
        we’ve managed to reduce the overall size of our CSS by about <strong>25%</strong> – from about 1.1MB to 855KB.

        I joined just after the launch of their new consumer-facing site as lead designer.
        We spent a month or so cleaning up small parts of the site, including the landing page,
        sign up flow, site navigation, visual branding, and the company blog.
        I worked with the Marketing Director to help develop an A/B testing strategy 
        for the site that she could run while we shifted our focus to internal tools.

        Based on company priorities and the bottlenecks in the user journey
        – new customers generally had to wait 4 – 6 weeks after signing up to actually use the service –
        we decided to turn our focus towards replacing the internal tool that the stylists used to research customers
        and choose the clothing and accessories we sent them.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The current tool was essentially a series of tables displaying the database. 
        We knew about a lot of low-hanging fruit,

            The first week, I ran testing sessions with four stylists.
            The sessions began with an open-ended contextual inquiry
            and lead into shadowing each participant as they
            went through their normal workflow.
            After transcribing highlights and taking notes,

        The next two weeks, we focused on sketching ideas and building rapid prototypes to test with.
        We came up with a lot of different ideas, including a binary image-based wizard flow,
        a keyboard command based app, a social-network like conversation view,
        and one that followed patterns from traditional e-commerce apps.
        In an effort to release an MVP soon, we decided to focus on the e-commerce-influenced direction.

      <h2 class="">Prototype to Rapid Prototype</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        I’d made plenty of prototypes in the past, using HTML & CSS and tools like Ratchet, Keynote, and Blueprint,
        but I knew next to nothing about Javascript and didn’t think my CSS was good enough to be production-ready.
        We originally planned to have the front-end developer build the actual app and to keep
        the prototypes on separate branches.
        At the time, the developer was busy working on other tools for our warehouse operations.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        After several code reviews and some coaching,
        we decided that we should just clean up the prototype and ship it,
        with the intent of consolidating components and better organizing the code as we went along.
        During that time, the front-end developer taught me a lot about CSS and front-end architecture,
        and I took it upon myself to learn more about Javascript and front-end MVCs.

        Although the team of stylists wasn't large enough to conduct an A/B test on,
        we wanted to be sure that the new app wouldn’t negatively affect their workflows.
        We decided to split the team into two groups:
        one continuing to use the old app and another using the new one.
        After about a week of use, the stylists more than doubled their output using the new app.
        We knew we had a clear winner, and switched the entire team over.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        During this time, we continued to shadow and monitor the stylists to make sure we 
        addressed any of their concerns.
        The development team and I also discussed the use of a front-end MVC framework
        instead of forcing jQuery to work in ways it wasn’t intended to.
        In my own time, I began teaching myself Angular JS and built

        I joined LivingSocial just before they raised a large round of funding and underwent tremendous growth.
        At the time they were using a very scrappy startup-like logo,
        and they wanted to elevate the brand to more accurately reflect the size of company they were becoming.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        Informed by branding work started by an outside agency,
        I worked on a team with two other designers, and we each began exploring and sketching ideas.
        About twice a week we would meet in person to share ideas and critique each others work.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        After a few weeks of sketching and critiquing,
        we paired down our options to two directions each to share with stakeholders across the company.
        Ultimately, type treatment from one of my options and a mark conceived by my coworker were chosen.
        She continued working on refining the concept and building out the branding system,
        while I began working on a revamp of the iPhone app.

            I found out that you should be careful what you leave in the gutters of your Illustrator artboards.
            As the final branding was revealed to the company,
            I noticed that some of my rough icon sketches were in heavy use.
            I was flattered, but I had to scramble to clean up the icons
            I’d started before they began showing up on billboards in Times Square.

      <h2 class="">The iPhone App</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        The platform was growing quickly and there was a desire to test out several new products in different markets.
        The iPhone app at the time was not well suited to scale to meet business goals,
        so a product manager, the iOS developer, and I began brainstorming and sketching ideas for the next version.
        I was also tasked with bringing the visual design inline with the new branding.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        I mocked up several directions for the app, using the new, still evolving visual identity,
        and regularly checked in with rest of the design team for group critiques,
        iterating on the different options as we went along.

      <p class="serif">
        With the desire to release the new app in time for our Super Bowl Ad,
        we iterated on a couple directions for an MVP
        and did guerilla usability testing in the Chinatown neighborhood of DC.
      </p>
      <h2 class="">Experimental Products</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        Over the next few weeks, we continued to iterate on the app,
        with a new release going out about once every two weeks.
        One of the big new products the company wanted to launch was a mobile-only
        instantly-redeemable deals platform.
        This product would only launch in specific cities and we explored several different options
        for how to handle the location-based app navigation.

      <p class="serif">
        Launching with a huge PR stunt in DC,
        with the company offering a $1 lunch for anyone using the new <i>Instant Deals</i> product,
        the backend infrastructure got hit hard,
        and the development team worked all day to keep things running.
        Meanwhile, the executive team realized that they needed a desktop counterpart
        for their mobile-only product.
      </p>
      <h2 class="">JSIO</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        Taking direction from the design of the mobile app,
        I worked closely with a front-end developer to design and build a desktop version.
        The CTO had a saying, JSIO: just shit it out – and that’s what we did.
        That was a long day.

            Around the same time, the company had been working with a local rails
            development agency to build merchant tools for these new products.
            LivingSocial acquired this agency,
            and I began working with them on information architecture and an MVP for the merchant tools.

        After several attempts at marketing <i>Instant Deals</i>, the business model just wasn’t working.
        The company decided to pivot this product into a direct competitor with Seamless.
        I worked on IA for an app that would host several hundred different restaurants
        with drastically different food menus.
        I spoke with several internal sales people and a few local restaurants to research what their needs were.

      <h2 class="">Scaling Information Architecture</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        The design team and the product grew quite a bit over the next few months.
        User research had shown that customers’ brand perception and understanding
        of our product offerings was failing our business goals.
        The newly hired UX Director got the entire design team together – about 16 of us – to work
        on the consumer-facing product’s IA.
        We split into five teams of three to four people each to brainstorm and sketch out ideas,
        meeting regularly with the entire team to critique and discuss.

        One of my coworkers on the team had conducted an online open card sort,
        and had been working with the user research and Marketing teams to help inform our direction.
        Using groupings and labels based on this research,
        we created a content model, proposed a navigation system for both mobile and desktop,
        and created a clickable prototype using Bootstrap to demonstrate a responsive
        website using this new system.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        After we stole a few ideas from the others, the design team decided that the direction
        my group had was the strongest. We presented it to the executives 
        and the rest of the product development team and got immediate buy in.

      <h2 class="">Reorganizing</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        Soon after, a few of us on the UX team went to <i>IA Summit</i> in New Orleans.
        I had a blast and was very inspired by the speakers I saw.
        But the timing of my flight caused me to miss an outside product management consultant’s
        work and presentation on our company’s process and organization.
        When I flew back to DC, the entire product development team was now organized by pods
        that aligned with the new product IA.

      <h2 class="">Championing a Mobile-First Approach</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        Part of the new IA and company organization required every designer to work on the mobile
        component of their product, rather than delegating it to a separate team.
        With the support of the UX Director, I was a huge proponent for mobile-first responsive design,
        and I spent most of my time working closely with the other designers on using this approach.
        I became the go-to guy for anything mobile related, and I learned a lot about teaching others.
      </p>
      <h2 class="">My Fifth Metacarpal</h2>
      <p class="serif">
        Shortly after, I was doored by a cab while riding my bike and broke the fifth metacarpal in my dominant hand.
        After talking to HR and my manager, I decided to
        continue working in a different capacity, in more of a UX director role
        and participated in or facilitated every design studio session the UX team held.
        I learned a lot then, including how it’s easier to type one handed than use Adobe apps,
        that my left-handed sketches looked more like cave paintings than interfaces,
        that cross-team strong communication can lead to a lot of great things,
        and that some of the most important parts of design process don’t require a computer at all.

        Hired as their first dedicated visual designer, I worked closely with the UX designer and web team

        I built out the visual style guide for the app, along with an icon system,
